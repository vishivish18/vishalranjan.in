				p.project-description(style='text-align:justify') My first experience with a real time project, got a wonderful chance to work with awesome people in the mountains of mussorie. Though this project never got released due to some issues, this contributes a major portion of my learning and understanding of programming. Video of the running project developed in Java is available alongside. We further went on developing the second version of this project on NodeJs. I will be writing a series of blog posts about my learning through this project and will upload a running model for this.

				p.project-title MKA
				p.project-subtitle A Desktop Application Which Cares For Your Health
				p.project-description(style='text-align:justify') MKA is an application aiming to improve your health related issues caused by sitting in front of computers for long hours via reminders. It is computer application that in equal intervals reminds you to take proper breaks.It is currently running version 1.0.2, which is a static application. We are thinking to take this further with computer intelligence involved so that it can study the user behavior and suggest breaks and reminders accordingly. This started as a fun project during college and was developed under Spectawith few awesome people. The code was written in Java. You can download the current version here

				p.project-description(style='text-align:justify') Developed out of curiosity of mine and demand of my two little demons (my nephew and niece) in one night, it remains one of the most important learning experiences, this project helped me understand what OOPS really means . Many of the concepts of object oriented programming became clear while doing this . Its built in Java and will soon extend it to OOJS (Object Oriented Java Script

				p.project-title Tic Tac Toe
				p.project-subtitle My Tryst With Artificial Intelligence
				p.project-description(style='text-align:justify') This remains my only experiment with AI (Artificial Inteliigence) till now. Developed a tic-tc toe game which can be played between two players or with a computer. It applies heuristic search and decides the relevant move. I wrote it in Java and currently working to convert it into online game using JavaScript. Since the intelligence developed last time did not have a learning approach, I will try to explore areas of NN and other learning patters while doing it again in JS </p>
