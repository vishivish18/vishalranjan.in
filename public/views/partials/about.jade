		p(style="text-align:justify;font-size:16px;") My name is Vishal Ranjan and I am an aspiring generalist, currently living and moving around North India. I am obssessed with the possibilities and beauty of programming in problem solving and fortunately what I do for passion and curiosity is my profession too. I have worked with #[a.hyper(href="http://exponential.com/") Exponential Interactive] and #[a.hyper-muse(href="http://musejam.com/") Musejam] in the past and currently I work with, #[a.hyper-cyber(href="http://cygrp.com/") Cyber Group] as a Team Lead. As an Artificial Intelligence consultant, I also help and consult some amazing folks at #[a.hyper-bs(href="http://botsupply.ai/") Botsupply] and #[a.hyper-jatana(href="http://jatana.ai/") Jatana] who are making user interactions and customer-service awesome, one bot at a time. When not coding, I read books , play the guitar and create Music with awesome musicians at #[a.hyper-mango(href="https://www.facebook.com/The-Tender-MANGO-Project-1502929549817289") The Tender Mango Project], take my bike to long solo rides and write some pretty bad poetry. More often than not I get lost in the woods or the hills to carve my wanderlust.
