	p(style="padding-left:300px;padding-right:300px;text-align:justify;font-size:16px;") My name is Vishal Ranjan and I am a full-stack web developer, currently living in New Delhi, India. I love anything that is JS and thus enjoy the MEAN stack. I have just started exploring python, and I am loving the parselmouth too. I have been an AI enthusiast and my next endevaours lie somewhere out there. I love the fact that what I do for passion and curiosity is my profession too. I worked with Exponential Interactive for a year and half, untill I joined Musejam as a web developer (a startup I work with currently). I also work with a superhero team at Specta creating things we want.  I read books , play the guitar and write some pretty bad poetry. I ocassionally get lost in the woods or the hills to carve my wanderlust.
	p(style="padding-left:300px;padding-right:300px;text-align:justify;font-size:16px;") If you want to hire me or want me to work on your next project , or may be just want to say hello. Get in touch
