		p(style="text-align:justify;font-size:16px;") My name is Vishal Ranjan and I am an aspiring generalist, currently living in New Delhi, India. I am obssessed with the possibilities and beauty of programming in problem solving. Fortunately what I do for passion and curiosity is my profession too. I have worked with #[a.hyper(href="http://exponential.com/") Exponential Interactive] and #[a.hyper(href="http://musejam.com/") Musejam] and currently I work with, #[a.hyper(href="http://cygrp.com/") Cyber Group] as a Senior Software Engineer. I also help and consult some amazing folks at #[a.hyper(href="http://botsupply.co/") Botsupply] who are making user interactions awesome, one bot at a time (Which includes AI and Machine Learning - My next endevaours). When not coding, I read books , play the guitar, take my bike to long solo rides and write some pretty bad poetry. More often than not I get lost in the woods or the hills to carve my wanderlust.
